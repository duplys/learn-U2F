              In practice, strong passwords are <b>impossible to memorize</b>, especially if you need dozens of them. As a result, most users choose simple &mdash; i.e., weak &mdash; passwords and re-use them across multiple accounts and online services.

              The FIDO Alliance mission is to change the nature of online strong authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core ideas driving the FIDO Alliance's efforts are 1) ease of use, 2) privacy andsecurity, and 3) standardization. The primary objective is to enable online services andwebsites, whether on the open Internet or within enterprises, to leverage native securityfeatures of end-user computing devices for strong user authentication and to reduce theproblems associated with creating and remembering many online credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two key protocols included in the FIDO architecture that cater to two basic optionsfor user experience when dealing with Internet services. The two protocols share many ofunderpinnings but are tuned to the specific intended use cases.Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) ProtocolThe U2F protocol allows online services to augment the security of their existing passwordinfrastructure by adding a strong second factor to user login. The user logs in with ausername and password as before. The service can also prompt the user to present asecond factor device at any time it chooses. The strong second factor allows the service tosimplify its passwords (e.g. 4-digit PIN) without compromising security.
            </p>
            <p>
              During registration and authentication, the user presents the second factor by simplypressing a button on a USB device or tapping over NFC. The user can use their FIDO U2Fdevice across all online services that support the protocol leveraging built-in support in webbrowsers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) ProtocolThe UAF protocol allows online services to offer password-less and multi-factor security.The user registers their device to the online service by selecting a local authenticationmechanism such as swiping a finger, looking at the camera, speaking into the mic, enteringa PIN, etc. The UAF protocol allows the service to select which mechanisms are presentedto the user.Once registered, the user simply repeats the local authentication action whenever theyneed to authenticate to the service. The user no longer needs to enter their password whenauthenticating from that device. UAF also allows experiences that combine multipleauthentication mechanisms such as fingerprint + PIN.

              Goal: Strong Authentication and Privacy for the Web
            </p>
            <p>
              The U2F eco-system is designed to provide strong authentication for users on the webwhile preserving the user's privacy. The user carries a 'U2F device' as a second factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the user registers the U2F device at an account at a particular origin (such ashttp://www.company.com) the device creates a new key pair usable only at that origin andgives the origin the public key to associate with the account. When the user authenticates(i.e., logs in) to the origin, in addition to username and password, the origin (in this case,http://www.company.com) can check whether the user has the U2F device by verifying asignature created by the device.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user is able to use the same device across multiple sites on the web - it thus serves asthe user's physical web keychain with multiple (virtual) keys to various sites provisionedfrom one physical device. Using the open U2F standard, any origin will be able to use anybrowser (or OS) which has U2F support to talk to any U2F compliant device presented bythe user to enable strong authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              The U2F device registration and authentication operations are exposed through JavaScriptAPIs built into the browser and, in following phases, native APIs in mobile OSes.

              The U2F device can be embodied in various form factors, such as stand alone USBdevices, stand alone Near Field Communication (NFC) device, stand alone Bluetooth LEdevices, built-on-board the user's client machine/mobile device as pure software or utilizingsecured crypto capabilities.

The lower layer specifies how the user's client will communicate U2Fcryptographic requests to the U2F device over a particular transport protocol (e.g., USB,NFC, Bluetooth LE, built-in on a particular OS, etc.).

              Site-Specific Public/Private Key Pairs
            </p>
            <p>
              At the core ofthe protocol, the U2F device has a capability (ideally, embodied in a secure element) whichmints an origin-specific public/private key pair. The U2F device gives the public key and aKey Handle to the origin online service or website during the user registration step.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, when the user performs an authentication, the origin online service or website sendsthe Key Handle back to the U2F device via the browser. The U2F device uses the KeyHandle to identify the user's private key, and creates a signature which is sent back to theorigin to verify the presence of the U2F device. Thus, the Key Handle is simply an identifierof a particular key on the U2F device.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key pair created by the U2F device during registration is origin specific. Duringregistration, the browser sends the U2F device a hash of the origin (combination of protocol,hostname and port). The U2F device returns a public key and a Key Handle. Veryimportantly, the U2F device encodes the requesting origin into the Key Handle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, when the user attempts to authenticate, the server sends the user's Key Handle backto the browser. The browser sends this Key Handle and the hash of the origin which isrequesting the authentication. The U2F device ensures that it had issued this Key Handle tothat particular origin hash before performing any signing operation. If there is a mismatch nosignature is returned.
            </p>
            <p>
              This origin check ensures that the public keys and Key Handles issued by a U2F device to aparticular online service or website cannot be exercised by a different online service orwebsite (i.e., a site with a different name on a valid SSL certificate). This is a critical privacyproperty - assuming the browser is working as it should, a site can verify identity stronglywith a user's U2F device only with a key which has been issued to that particular site by thatparticular U2F device. If this origin check was not present, a public key and Key Handleissued by a U2F device could be used as a 'supercookie' which allows multiple colludingsites to strongly verify and correlate a particular user's identity.

            <p>
              The U2F device device has a physical 'test of user presence'. The user touches a button (orsensor of some kind) to 'activate' the U2F device and this feeds into the device's operationas follows:
              <ul>

              <li>Authentication: During authentication, the browser sends some data down to the U2Fdevice that it needs to sign (more about this later). The U2F device can be requestedto require a 'test of user presence' before it will sign - e.g., the user has to press abutton on the device.

              Man-In-The-Middle Protections During Authentication
            </p>
            <p>
              Say a user has correctly registered a U2F device with an origin and later, a MITM on adifferent origin tries to intermediate the authentication. In this case, the user's U2F devicewon't even respond, since the MITM's (different) origin name will not match the Key Handlethat the MITM is relaying from the actual origin. U2F can also be leveraged to detect moresophisticated MITM situations as we shall see below.
            </p>
            <p>
              As one of the return values of the U2F 'sign' call, the browser returns an object whichcontains information about what the browser sees about the origin (we will call this the'client data' object). This 'client data' includes:
              <ul>
                <li>the random challenge sent by the origin</li>
                <li>the origin host name seen by the browser for the web page making the javascript call, and</li>
                <li>[optionally] if the ChannelID extension to TLS is used, the connection's channelID public key.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The browser sends a hash of this 'client data' to the U2F device. In addition to the hash ofthe 'client data', as discussed earlier, the browser sends the hash of the origin and the KeyHandle as additional inputs to the U2F device.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the U2F device receives the client data hash, the origin hash and the Key Handle itproceeds as follows: If it had indeed issued that Key Handle for that origin the U2F deviceproceeds to issue a signature across the hashed 'client data' which were sent to it. Thissignature is returned back as another return value of the U2F 'sign' call.
            </p>
            <p>
              The site's web page which made the U2F 'sign' call sends the return values, both the 'clientdata' and the signature, back to the origin site (or equivalently, relying party). On receivingthe 'client data' and the signature, the relying party's first step, of course, is to verify that thesignature matches the data as verified by the user's origin-specific public key. Assuming thismatches, the relying party can examine the 'client data' further to see if any MITM is present.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is still possible to MITM a user's authentication to a site if the MITM is
              <ul>
                <li>able to get a server cert for the actual origin name issued by a valid CA, and</li>
                <li>ChannelIDs are NOT supported by the browser</li>
              </ul>
              But this is quite a high bar.
            </p>
            <p>
              An MITM case which the U2F device does NOT protect against is as follows: Consider an online service or website which accepts plain password but allows users to self-register and step up to U2F 2nd factor. An MITM with a different origin which is present between the user and the actual site from the time of registration can register the U2F device on to itself and not pass this registration to the actual origin, which would still see the user as just needing a password. Later, for authentications, the MITM can accept the U2F device and just do an authentication with password to the actual origin.

              Allowing for Inexpensive U2F Devices
            </p>
            <p>
              A key goal of this program is to enable extremely inexpensive yet secure devices. To enablenew secure element chips to be as inexpensive as possible it is important to allow them tohave minimal or no onboard memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              A U2F device allows for this. The Key Handle issued by the U2F device does not have to be an index to the private key stored on board the U2F device secure element chip. Instead, the Key Handle can 'store' (i.e., contain) the private key for the origin and the hash of the origin encrypted with a 'wrapping' key known only to the U2F device secure element. When the Key Handle goes back to the secure element it 'unwraps' it to 'retrieve' the private key and the origin that it was generated for.
            </p>
            <p>
              As another alternative, the U2F device could store this 'wrapped' information in a table in off-chip memory outside the secure element (which is presumably cheaper). This memory is still on board the U2F device. In this case, the Key Handle sent to the origin would be an index into this table in off-chip memory. As another possibility in the design spectrum, the Key Handle might only encode the origin and an index number, while the private key might still be kept on board - this would, of course, imply the number of keys is limited by the amount of memory.

              Verifying That a U2F Device Is 'genuine'
            </p>
            <p>
              A U2F device must be certified by a trustworthy certification authority to ensure that it uses strong cryptography and is properly implemented. The relying party needs to able to identify the type ofdevice it is speaking to in a strong way so that it can check against a database to see if thatdevice type has the certification characteristics that particular relying party cares about. So,for example, a financial services site may choose to only accept hardware-backed U2Fdevices, while some other site may allow U2F devices implemented in software.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Every U2F device has a shared 'Attestation' key pair which is present on it - this key isshared across a large number of U2F device units made by the same vendor (this is toprevent individual identifiability of the U2F device). Every public key output by the U2Fdevice during the registration step is signed with the attestation private key.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intention is that the public keys of all the 'Attestation' key pairs used by each vendor willbe available in the public domain - this could be implemented by certificates chaining to aroot public key or literally as a list. Thus, a particular relying party - say, a bank - mightchoose to accept only U2F devices from certain vendors which have the appropriatepublished certifications. To enforce this policy, it can verify that the public key from a U2Fdevice presented by the user is from a vendor it trusts.

              Counters as a Signal for Detecting Cloned U2F Devices
            </p>
            <p>
              The U2F device protocol incorporates a usage counter to allow the origin to detect problemsin some circumstances. The U2F device remembers a count of the number of signatureoperations it has performed - either per key pair (if it has sufficient memory) or globally (if ithas a memory constraint, this leaks some privacy across keys) or even something in between (e.g., buckets of keys sharing a counter, with a bit less privacy leakage). The U2Fdevice sends the actual counter value back to the browser which relays it to the origin afterevery signing operation. The U2F device also concatenates the counter value on to thehash of the client data before signing so that the origin can strongly verify that the countervalue was not tampered with (by the browser).
            </p>
            <p>
              The server can compare the counter value that the U2F device sent it and compare itagainst the counter value it saw in earlier interactions with the same U2F device. If thecounter value has moved backward, it signals that there is more than one U2F device withthe same key pair for the origin (i.e., a clone of the U2F device has been created at somepoint).

              The to-be-registered user is verified by the origin site (e.g., with username and password). The registration page rendered by the origin in the browser calls the javascript function for creating a key pair. When the javascript function is called, the user may see a browser infobar warning which he/she has to approve.

              The first U2F device attached to the computer which has a positive 'test of user presence'(i.e., the first attached U2F device on which the user presses the button) responds to this request. The browser packages the response from the U2F device (key handle, public key,etc.) and returns it to the web page as return results of the javascript function call. The registration web page sends these to the origin site and the origin sites stores this information indexed by the user's account to complete the registration process.

              The user starts the authentication process typically with username and password (or withjust the username, if the site only wants a U2F device verification). The origin site rendersan intermediate authentication page into which it sends the user's Key Handle and a nonce.It then calls the javascript function to create a signature.

So for example, a user might have a U2F device mounted permanently ontwo different computers, where each U2F device is registered to the same account on aparticular origin - thus allowing both computers to login securely to that particular origin.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a user has registered multiple U2F devices to a particular account, then duringauthentication all the Key Handles are sent by the origin to the intermediate page. Theintermediate page call the signature javascript function with the array of Key Handles andsends the aggregated response back to the origin. Each attached activated U2F devicesigns for those Key Handles in the array that it recognizes. The user authenticationexperience is unchanged.

              U2F Privacy Considerations: A Recap
            </p>
            <p>
              User privacy is a fundamental design consideration forthe U2F protocol. The various privacy related design points are reiterated here:
              <ul>
                <li>A U2F device does not have a global identifier visible across online services or websites.</li>
                <li>A U2F device does not have a global identifier within a particular online service orwebsite. For instance, if a person loses their U2F device, the finder cannot 'point it at a website' to see if some accounts get listed. The device simply does not know. As yet another example, if person A and B share a U2F device and they have each registeredtheir accounts on site X with this device, there isn't any way for the site X toguess that the two accounts share a device based on the U2F protocol alone.</li>
                <li>A key issued to a particular online service or website can only be exercised by thatonline service or website. Since a key is essentially a strong identifier this means U2F does not give anysignal which allows online services or websites to strongly cross-identify sharedusers.</li>
                <li>A user has to activate the U2F device (i.e., 'press the button') before it will issue a keypair (for registration) or sign a challenge.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              But: The origin specific key issuance still leaves one possible privacy leak &mdash; which is the casewhere a person with a single U2F device uses it to generate keys to two separate accountswith the same origin. Say the two different accounts are associated with usernames u_1 andu_2 in the site's name space. Now when u_1 is attempting to authenticate, the origin cansend down KeyHandle_2 to the U2F device. If it returns a valid signature, it can infer thatu_1 and u_2 belong to the same person or two persons who share the same computer whohappen to have their U2F devices plugged in simultaneously. This is true even if the usershave taken precautions to hide their client identity from the origin server (using ananonymizing proxy, incognito mode, etc.).

              FIDO Alliance
            </p>
            <p>
              The FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance is an open industry association launched in February 2013 whose mission is to develop and promote authentication standards that help reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords. FIDO addresses the lack of interoperability among strong authentication devices and reduces the problems users face creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords.
            </p>
            <p>
              FIDO was founded by Agnitio, Infineon, Lenovo, Nok Nok Labs, PayPal and Validity Sensors.[2] By the end of September 2016, FIDO members totaled more than 260, including a board made up of Aetna, Alibaba Group, Amazon, American Express, ARM, Bank of America, BC Card, Broadcom, CrucialTec, Daon, Egis Technology, Feitian, Gemalto, Google, HYPR, Infineon, Intel, ING, Lenovo, MasterCard, Microsoft, Nok Nok Labs, NTT DoCoMo, NXP Semiconductors, Oberthur Technologies, PayPal, Qualcomm, RSA, Samsung Electronics, Synaptics, USAA, Visa, VMware, OneSpan, Yubico and Apple Inc representatives.

              The FIDO U2F protocol enables relying parties to offer a strong cryptographic 2nd factoroption for end user security. The relying party's dependence on passwords is reduced. Thepassword can even be simplified to a 4-digit PIN. End users carry a single U2F device whichworks with any relying party supporting the protocol. The user gets the convenience of asingle 'keychain' device and convenient security. This document is an overview of the U2Fprotocol and is a recommended first-read before reading detailed protocol documents.

            <h2>What is Universal 2nd Factor Authentication?</h2>
            <p class="text-intro">
              The USB devices communicate with the host computer using the human interface device (HID) protocol, essentially mimicking a keyboard.[8] This avoids the need for the user to install special hardware driver software in the host computer, and permits application software (such as a browser) to directly access the security features of the device without user effort other than possessing and inserting the device. Once communication is established, the application exercises a challenge–response authentication with the device using public-key cryptography methods and a secret unique device key manufactured into the device.[9] The device key is vulnerable to malicious manufacturer duplication, and logically secured against reverse-engineering or counterfeiting by the robustness of the encryption and physical possession.

            <p class="text-intro">
              U2F security keys are supported by Google Chrome since version 38[2] and Opera since version 40. U2F security keys can be used as an additional method of two-step verification on online services that support the U2F protocol, including Google,[2] ,[10] GitHub,[11] GitLab,[12] Bitbucket,[13] Nextcloud,[14] Facebook,[15] and others.[16]
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-intro"></p>
              Chrome, Firefox, and Opera were, as of 2015, the only browsers supporting U2F natively. Microsoft has enabled FIDO 2.0 support for Windows 10's Windows Hello login platform.[17] Microsoft Edge[18] browser gained support for U2F in the October 2018 Windows Update. Microsoft accounts, including Office 365, OneDrive, and other Microsoft services, do not yet have U2F support. Mozilla has integrated it into Firefox 57, and enabled it by default in Firefox 60[19][20][21][22] and Thunderbird 60.[23] Microsoft Edge starting from build 17723 support FIDO2.[24]. As of iOS and iPadOS 13.3 Apple now supports U2F in the Safari browser on those platforms.

            <p class="text-intro">
            Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) is an open standard that strengthens and simplifies two-factor authentication (2FA) using specialized Universal Serial Bus (USB) or near-field communication (NFC) devices based on similar security technology found in smart cards.

            <p class="text-intro">
              The U2F standard has undergone two major revisions:

            <ul>
              <li>U2F 1.0 Proposed Standard (October 9, 2014)[25]</li>
              <li>U2F 1.2 Proposed Standard (April 11, 2017)[26]</li>
            </ul>

            Additional specification documents may be obtained from the FIDO web site.[27]

            The U2F 1.0 Proposed Standard (October 9, 2014) was the starting point for a short-lived specification known as the FIDO 2.0 Proposed Standard (September 4, 2015). The latter was formally submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on November 12, 2015.[28] Subsequently, the first Working Draft of the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard was published on May 31, 2016. The WebAuthn standard has been revised numerous times since then, becoming a W3C Recommendation on March 4, 2019.

            Meanwhile the U2F 1.2 Proposed Standard (April 11, 2017) became the starting point for the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) Proposed Standard, which was published on September 27, 2017. FIDO CTAP complements W3C WebAuthn, both of which are in scope for the FIDO2 Project.

            WebAuthn and CTAP provide a complete replacement for U2F, which has been renamed "CTAP1" in the latest version of the FIDO2 standard.[29] The WebAuthn protocol is backward-compatible (via the AppID extension) with U2F-only security keys[30] but the U2F protocol is not compatible with a WebAuthn-only authenticator.[31][32][29] Some authenticators support both U2F and WebAuthn while some WebAuthn clients support keys created via the legacy U2F API.[citation needed]
