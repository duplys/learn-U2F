# Introduction
Material for teaching (and learning) Universal 2 Factor (U2F) authentication.

# Misc
* Google seems to use cookies with 2FA to check whether you're logging in from a new device (and then require you to use the 2nd factor)
* It would be interesting to have a dedicated 2nd practical part
* A potential extension of this training: a tutorial on implementing U2F in JavaScript
